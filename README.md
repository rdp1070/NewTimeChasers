# NewTimeChasers
A redo of an old flash game I made freshman year. 
Origonally written in as3 about 4 years ago, I have rewrote this game in JS to bring it into 2016. 

Your job is a collecting Green gems, you are a rocketeer in a cute little rocket ship. However,
the gems you grab from space create time distortions, sometimes those just happen by themselves. 
The distortions come in two varieties, red and blue. Red are the angry ones, that want to rip you back.
The Blue are the counter to the red, allowing you more time. Use the Blue time orbs to aid your quest in getting
as many gems as possible! The game is over when the time runs out. :)
